House Price Prediction - EDA and Preprocessing Report

1. Data Overview
----------------
- The dataset was loaded from '../data/data.csv'.
- No null values were found; the dataset is clean.
- Initial features included: country, street, city, statezip, date, waterfront, price, and various numerical features.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
----------------------------------
- Visualizations were created to understand the distribution of house prices by city, total and median prices, and the number of listings per city and condition.
- Scatterplots and correlation analysis were performed to identify relationships between features and the target variable (price).
- The top 5 features most correlated with price were visualized using regression plots.
- The impact of renovation and waterfront presence on price was explored.

3. Feature Selection
--------------------
- Dropped unnecessary features: 'country', 'street', 'date', and 'waterfront'.
- Outliers with price > 10,000,000 were removed.

4. Feature Encoding
-------------------
- 'statezip': Removed the 'WA' prefix and converted the remaining string to a numeric value.
- 'city': Applied ordinal encoding based on average price per city (lowest average price = 1, highest = N).

5. Feature Scaling
------------------
- Visualized the distribution of all numerical features to choose appropriate scaling methods.
- StandardScaler was used for 'sqft_living' and 'sqft_above'.
- MinMaxScaler was used for 'yr_built', 'yr_renovated', 'sqft_basement', and 'sqft_lot'.
- Original columns were dropped after scaling.

6. Data Export
--------------
- The cleaned and preprocessed data was saved to '../data/cleaned_data.csv'.

Summary
-------
The dataset is now ready for model training and selection, with all features encoded and scaled appropriately. EDA has provided insights into the most important features affecting house prices.
